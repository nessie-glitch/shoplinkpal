  <h1>ShopLinkPal Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: March 4, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>ShopLinkPal is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle data in our Chrome extension:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ShopLinkPal stores referral links and coupon codes locally in your browser using Chrome storage.</li>
    <li>No personal data (e.g., name, email) is collected or shared unless you opt into future shared features (e.g., syncing across devices).</li>
    <li>We do not track your browsing history, location, or other personal information beyond what you voluntarily enter (e.g., referral details).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Data is used solely to enable the extension’s functionality (saving, sharing, alerting).</p>
  <p>Local storage ensures your referrals stay private to your device unless you enable sharing in future updates.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to outside parties.</p>
  <p>Future shared features (e.g., syncing referrals) will require your consent and a separate privacy notice.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can clear local storage via Chrome settings (Extensions → ShopLinkPal → Clear Data).</p>
  <p>Ensure referral links and coupon codes comply with their providers’ terms (e.g., Amazon, Uber).</p>

  <h2>Support Link</h2>
  <p>ShopLinkPal includes a voluntary support link to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/steve79458" target="_blank">ko-fi.com/steve79458</a>, which you can use to donate if you wish. No data is shared or collected through this link unless you choose to interact with it. Your decision to support is entirely optional and does not affect the extension’s functionality.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:steve@maydaymail.com">steve@maydaymail.com</a> or through the Chrome Web Store listing.</p>

  <p>ShopLinkPal is not responsible for third-party referral or coupon terms. Use codes responsibly and check
